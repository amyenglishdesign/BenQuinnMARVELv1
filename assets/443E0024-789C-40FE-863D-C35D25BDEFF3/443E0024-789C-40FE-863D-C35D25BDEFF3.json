Nobody sits down to watch an AVENGERS movie and feels like they’ve ever set foot in that world. Our locations and cast have to be as true to life as we can make them. It’s natural light on real faces. No one should look like they’ve been in hair and makeup. When you look around you find interesting characters exist everywhere. I’m more interested on the faces I see on the bus than in most casting sessions. Since the levity of the spot comes from the contrast between superheroes and us, we have to find the faces and places that resemble what anyone sees when they look out their window.","targetRectangle":{"y":445.2479157512836,"x":1024.410924173702,"width":792.5708618164072,"height":324.0000128746033}},{"text":"￼","targetRectangle":{"y":829.7396010011435,"x":957,"width":6,"height":20.92499680817127}},{"text":"D1 - 3.jpg","targetRectangle":{"y":-96.81843153804947,"x":-172.6887417777398,"width":2265.377535595995,"height":1098.831427029683}}],"baseLayer":{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":960,"pointY":440},"width":1920,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":880,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"objectID":"0","layers":[{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":960,"pointY":440},"width":1920,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,-0.0004296425620922507,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":880,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"layers":[{"animations":[],"layers":[],"texturedRectangle":{"isBackgroundTexture":false,"singleTextureOpacity":1,"textureType":0,"textBaseline":0,"textXHeight":0,"isVerticalText":false},"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":960,"pointY":440},"width":1920,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":0,"height":880,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"texture":"2954649FEAE6E3D4F291DAC716FEEA85"}]}]}}]}
