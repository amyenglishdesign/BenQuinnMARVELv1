A lot of times my subject won’t even notice when the “scene” has started. A big part of my job, especially with non-actors is to make the talent feel relaxed in the unnatural situation of having a camera pointed at you. I want them to feel there are no mistakes, so we can release their energy and humor. In the end, we still need to get them in rhythm to match the set up of the camera movement, So while I’m lightly guiding them, we’ll hone the choreography of their actions so their gestures and expressions give us a comic similarity to the Marvel footage.
