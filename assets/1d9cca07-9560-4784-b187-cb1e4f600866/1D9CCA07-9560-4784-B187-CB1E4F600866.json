The slow motion that dominates a lot of these walking shots requires that we are conscious of exactly which assets we are cutting into and out of, so there’s not an awkward transition between speed ramps on MCU shots that weren’t originally intended to be cut together. We’ll vary the speed and angle at which characters approach the camera. Many of the most iconic shots we’ll be borrowing from the MCU are meticulously composed. We’ll be using the chaos of the outside world to create a contrast.
